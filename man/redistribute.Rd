\title{Calculate percentage of votes/seats after excluding parties with
\code{votes < hurdle}}
\usage{
redistribute(survey, hurdle = 0.05, others = "others", epsilon = 1e-05)
}
\arguments{
\item{survey}{The actual survey results on which \code{dirichlet.draws}
were based on.}

\item{hurdle}{The percentage threshold which has to be reached by a party
to enter the parliament.}

\item{others}{A string indicating the name under which parties not listed
explicitly are subsumed.}

\item{epsilon}{Percentages should add up to 1. If they do not, within accuracy
of \code{epsilon}, an error is thrown.}
